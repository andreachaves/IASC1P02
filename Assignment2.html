			<h2> About The Player: Andrea Chaves</h2>
		</div>
		<p class="fontColor">
			I began playing squash at the age of 6. I was a <em>competetive player</em> all my life playing in all the Gold tournaments including ones close to home like Niagara-on-the-Lake and Toronto as well as some not so close to home such as ones in Amsterdam, Germany and at Yale University. I am currently the top spot in the Women's Varsity Squash team at Brock University and coach kids ages 4-18 and every now and then adults as well at my home club; White Oaks Resort and Spa. Throughout my time as an athlete I have always enjoyed playing squash with my siblings and father who also play as well as with my fellow companions from the squash program we trained in. Squash has always been a part of my life and I think it always will be. It has developed my hand-eye coordination where in high school I was an all racquet sport sort of player. In high school I was on the squash, tennis, and badminton team. Although my swing was very improper for the other two sports I was still able to quickly catch on and be a top player on the team of all three sports. I feel like this page may come off as cocky which is <strong>not</strong> where I was heading for because I really am not, this however is pretty much all I do other than school so it is something very easy for me to write about. Anyway, enjoy this page on squash and its relation to me and my life.
